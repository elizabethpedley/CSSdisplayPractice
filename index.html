           <h2>JavaScript Basics</h2>
           <p>JavaScript is cross-platform, object oriented scripting language. Javscript is extremley popular for a variety of reasons. It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take in a bunch of different directions. JavaScript lives inside a host enviroment(a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to objects of these enviroments to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
           <ul id="contentList">
               <li><a href="/">Variable Declaration</a> JavaScript Variable are container for storing data values - imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value. All JavaScript variables must be indentified with unique names. These unique names are called indentifiers. <span>var x;</span></li>
               <li><a href="/">Variable Assignment</a> Assignment operators assgin values to JavaScript variables - our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our variables a value to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable.<span>var x=10;</span></li>
               <li><a href="/">Data Types</a> Data Types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type. There are six data types that are javascript primitives. Boolean - <span>True</span > or <span>False;</span>null- <span>null</span> aka nothing; Number - <span>42</span> or <span>3.14159;</span> String -<span>"Coding Dojo Rocks!";</span> Array - <span>[1,"Coding",2,"Dojo"];</span> and Object - <span>{first_name:"Jane",last_name:"Doe"}</span></li>
               <li><a href="/">Conditionals</a> When you write code you want to perform different actions for different decisions - hitting different code blocks based on values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional statments in your code to accomplish this. There are the following conditional statements: <span>if</span> a specified condition is true, do this code in our code block; <span>else if</span> to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is flase;<span> else</span> we execute this block of code;</li>
               <li><a href="/">Loops</a>  There are many different loops in every kind of propgramming language, but they all essntially do the same thing: they will repeat an action for some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop. Thats a loop!</li>
               <li><a href="/">Functions</a> Function are an encapselation of a code block. When we call our function this will call our code block. Think of this as a list of instructions. As an example imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction manuel and get started, first we screw the legs into the table top; next we place the table the right way up. Done! We finished our instructions. Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so lets call our functions over and over and over again.</li>
